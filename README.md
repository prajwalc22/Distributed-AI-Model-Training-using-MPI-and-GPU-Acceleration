# 🚀 Distributed AI Model Training using MPI and GPU Acceleration

This project demonstrates how High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques can drastically accelerate deep learning training using **MPI-based distributed computing**, **multi-GPU acceleration**, and **PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)**.

A **MobileNetV2** image classification model is trained on the **CIFAR-10** dataset under three configurations:

- CPU Serial Training
- Single GPU Training
- Multi-GPU Distributed Training (MPI + DDP)

The project also includes a **Gradio web interface** for real-time inference.

## 🧠 Objective

Deep learning models are computationally intensive. Training on a single device becomes slow and inefficient as model complexity increases.

This project explores how much training time can be reduced using **MPI + Multi-GPU parallelism** without compromising model accuracy.
